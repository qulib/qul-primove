# QUL Primo VE skin
This is the front end for QUL's Primo VE front end (to be launched Dec.10, 2019)

## First step
1. You'll need to create a zip file of the directory with the same name (01OCUL_QU:QU_DEFAULT.zip). Make sure there are no extra files (e.g. .DS_Store) as these will cause an error during upload. 

## To activate in Alma
1. Go to Configure Views
1. Edit the "Queen's University" view (aka 01OCUL_QU:QU_DEFAULT)
1. Choose the "Manage Customization Package" tab
1. Under "Upload Package", browse to the zip file you created and click "Upload"
1. Hit the "Save" button (neat the top of the screen). 

The skin should now be live in Primo VE.
